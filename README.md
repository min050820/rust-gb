# rust-gb
A gameboy emulator written in rust.

## Why create another emulator? There's a bunch of gameboy emulators!
I wanted to extend my skills, and emulators looks like a black magic to me.
So I decided to write an emulator.
I feel like I understand computers better.
And emulators still look like a black magic.
